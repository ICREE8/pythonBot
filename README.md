# Python Currency Bot
A Python currency bot is a basic application that allows users to quickly and easily convert between different currencies. By leveraging a currency exchange API, such as the one provided by Fixer.io, the bot can access real-time exchange rates and provide accurate conversions.

### Retrieving Exchange Rates: Using the Fixer.io API, the bot fetches the latest exchange rates for various currency pairs.
### User Input: The bot prompts the user to enter the amount they wish to convert, the base currency, and the target currency.
### Conversion Calculation: Based on the provided information and the retrieved exchange rates, the bot performs the necessary calculations to determine the converted amount.
### Displaying Results: The bot presents the calculated result to the user, along with the date and time of the conversion.

# Enhanced Bot Experience

## To improve the user experience, the bot can incorporate additional features such as:

### History: Storing a record of previous conversions for easy reference.
### Favorites: Allowing users to save frequently used currency pairs.
### Multiple Languages: Supporting different languages to cater to a wider audience.
### Integration: Integrating with messaging platforms or voice assistants for convenient access.

By implementing these enhancements, the currency bot becomes a more versatile and user-friendly tool for various needs.
